Installing dependencies for macOS.
==> Caveats
The Tcl/Tk GUIs (e.g. gitk, git-gui) are now in the `git-gui` formula.
Subversion interoperability (git-svn) is now in the `git-svn` formula.

To start redis now and restart at login:
  brew services start redis
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/redis/bin/redis-server /opt/homebrew/etc/redis.conf

==> Pouring openal-soft--1.23.1.arm64_ventura.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
openal-soft is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS provides OpenAL.framework.

If you need to have openal-soft first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openal-soft/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openal-soft you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openal-soft/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openal-soft/include"

For pkg-config to find openal-soft you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openal-soft/lib/pkgconfig"
